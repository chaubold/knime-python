#  ECLIPSE with only the license terms in place for ECLIPSE applying to
#  ECLIPSE and the GNU GPL Version 3 applying for KNIME, provided the
#  license terms of ECLIPSE themselves allow for the respective use and
#  propagation of ECLIPSE together with KNIME.
#
#  Additional permission relating to nodes for KNIME that extend the Node
#  Extension (and in particular that are based on subclasses of NodeModel,
